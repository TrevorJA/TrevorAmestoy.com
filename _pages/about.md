Hi, welcome to my site.

I am a Ph.D. Student at Cornell University in the [Reed Research Group](https://reed.cee.cornell.edu/), studying decision making under deep uncertainty for water resources.



# Academic Interests

Broadly, my academic interests revolve around the use of computational methods to support decision making for water resource systems under conditions of deep uncertainty.  

I am a frequent contributor on the [WaterProgramming Blog](waterprogramming.wordpress.com), where I post tutorials and tips.

You can find some of my past and future tools on [my GitHub](https://github.com/TrevorJA).


**My projects:**
- [Pywr-DRB: An open-source model for water availability and drought risk assessment in the Delaware River Basin](https://github.com/Pywr-DRB/Pywr-DRB)
- [AquaticAlgorithms: A N-day program to introduce high school students to concepts of hydrology and modeling](https://github.com/TrevorJA/AquaticAlgorithms)


# Personal Background

I was raised in New Mexico, and attended NM public schools until 2021 (Rio Rancho High & UNM).

I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering with a concentration in water resources from the University of New Mexico. Over the last few years I have been fortunate to work in various hydrologic contexts including: UNM Center for Water & Environment, the Great Dismal Swamp via an NSF-funded REU at Virginia Tech, and the Bureau of Reclamation's Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility.  

In my free time, I go trail running and cycling when the Ithaca weather allows. Else, I enjoy reading Sci-Fi, and making [generative art](trevoramestoy.com).
