The 2019 Peace Engineering Consortium was held at the University of New Mexico in partnership with the Global ENgineering Deans Council, Sandia National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Stanford's Peace Innovation Lab.

I will take time to reflect on this event at another time, but this page will serve as a placeholder for now.
